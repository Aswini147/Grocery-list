For the task, I crafted a small yet functional Grocery List Web Page, leveraging the power of JavaScript to dynamically update and enhance the user experience. 🍎📝

This challenge delved into the core concepts of manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) with JavaScript, allowing me to create and modify HTML elements dynamically. From user interaction to real-time updates, it's amazing to witness the potential of JavaScript in action! 🚀💻
During this challenge I used HTML DOM, Arrays etc..

Looking forward to the next set of challenges in this 30-day journey! Let's keep coding and learning together! 🚀👩‍💻
